## SECTION 1: INDIVIDUAL TAX RETURNS - DETAILED GUIDANCE

### 1.1 FILING STATUS DETERMINATION

Filing status is one of the most critical determinations in preparing an individual tax return. The filing status affects tax rates, standard deduction amounts, eligibility for various credits, and phase-out thresholds.

#### 1.1.1 Single Filing Status
A taxpayer qualifies for Single filing status if on the last day of the tax year, they were:
- Unmarried, OR
- Legally separated from their spouse under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance, OR
- A widow(er) and did not remarry before the end of the year

**Key Considerations:**
- Same-sex marriages are recognized for federal tax purposes following the Windsor decision
- Common law marriages are recognized if valid under state law
- Separation without a court decree does not change marital status
- Annulled marriages are treated as if they never existed

#### 1.1.2 Married Filing Jointly (MFJ)
Married couples may elect to file a joint return if married on the last day of the tax year. Both spouses report all income and deductions on the same return.

**Advantages of MFJ:**
- Typically lowest tax rates
- Highest standard deduction
- Eligibility for many credits (EITC, Education Credits)
- Higher income thresholds for phase-outs

**Joint and Several Liability:**
- Both spouses are liable for entire tax on joint return
- Innocent spouse relief may be available (Form 8857)
- Three forms of relief: Traditional Innocent Spouse, Separation of Liability, Equitable Relief

**Special Situations:**
- Spouse died during year: Can still file jointly for that year
- Nonresident alien spouse: Joint return possible with election to treat as resident
- Spouse away from home: Still considered married if absence is temporary

#### 1.1.3 Married Filing Separately (MFS)
Married taxpayers may elect to file separate returns. This is often disadvantageous but may benefit certain situations.

**When MFS May Be Beneficial:**
- Spouse has significant tax liability (prevents joint and several liability)
- One spouse has substantial unreimbursed medical expenses
- State tax benefit in certain states
- One spouse has defaulted student loans
- Divorce proceedings in progress

**MFS Limitations and Penalties:**
- Cannot claim EITC
- Cannot claim certain education credits
- Child Tax Credit phase-out begins at lower threshold
- Social Security benefits may be more taxable
- IRA contribution deduction phase-out begins at $0
- Standard deduction is 50% of MFJ
- Must both itemize or both use standard deduction if living together

#### 1.1.4 Head of Household (HOH)
Head of Household provides beneficial tax treatment for unmarried taxpayers supporting dependents.

**Requirements:**
1. Unmarried or considered unmarried on December 31
2. Paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year
3. A qualifying person lived with you for more than half the year (exceptions apply)

**Considered Unmarried Test:**
- Filed separate return
- Spouse did not live in home during last 6 months of year
- Paid more than half cost of maintaining home
- Home was main home of qualifying child for more than half year
- Can claim exemption for qualifying child (or could except for agreement to let other parent claim)

**Cost of Keeping Up a Home Includes:**

- Repairs and maintenance
- Home insurance
- Food eaten at home

**Does NOT Include:**
- Clothing
- Education
- Medical expenses
- Vacations

#### 1.1.5 Qualifying Surviving Spouse
Formerly known as Qualifying Widow(er), this status allows surviving spouses to use joint return tax rates for two years following the year of death.

**Requirements:**
- Spouse died in one of the two preceding years
- Could have filed jointly in year of death
- Did not remarry before end of current year
- Have a dependent child (son, stepson, daughter, stepdaughter)

- AMT Foreign Tax Credit adjustment
- Net Section 1256 contracts gain
- Claiming credit for prior year minimum tax

#### 1.9.2 AMT Calculation Process

**Step 1: Start with Taxable Income**
Begin with regular taxable income from Form 1040.

**Step 2: Add AMT Adjustments**
These are items treated differently for AMT:

**Standard Deduction (Add Back):**
- Standard deduction not allowed for AMT
- Must add back if taken on regular return

**State and Local Taxes (Add Back):**
- SALT deduction not allowed for AMT
- Add back property taxes, state income taxes
- Major source of AMT for many taxpayers

**Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions:**
- 2% floor deductions not allowed for AMT
- Currently suspended anyway under TCJA

**Medical Expenses:**
- Same 7.5% floor applies for AMT
- No adjustment needed currently

**Home Equity Interest:**
- Interest on home equity debt not used to buy, build, or improve home
- Add back for AMT
- Acquisition debt interest is allowed

**Depreciation Adjustment:**
- Different depreciation methods for AMT
- 150% declining balance vs. 200% for certain property
- Adjustment represents timing difference

**Incentive Stock Options:**
- Spread at exercise (FMV - exercise price) is AMT preference
- Not included in regular income until sale
- Major AMT trigger item
- AMT credit available when stock sold

**Passive Activities:**
- Recalculate passive loss limitations using AMT income
- May result in different deductible amount

**Net Operating Loss:**
- AMT NOL may differ from regular NOL
- Must recalculate using AMT rules
- 90% limitation applies to AMT NOL

**Step 3: Add Preference Items**
Preference items are always addbacks (never subtractions):

**Private Activity Bond Interest:**
- Interest on certain private activity bonds
- Municipal bonds issued for private purposes
- Exempt for regular tax, preference for AMT

**Percentage Depletion:**
- Excess of percentage depletion over adjusted basis
- Only amount exceeding basis is preference

**Intangible Drilling Costs:**
- Excess IDC deduction over 10-year amortization
- Phased in for independent producers

**Step 4: Calculate AMTI**
Alternative Minimum Taxable Income = Taxable Income + Adjustments + Preferences

**Step 5: Apply Exemption**

**2024 AMT Exemption Amounts:**
- Single/HOH: $85,700
- MFJ/QSS: $133,300
- MFS: $66,650
- Estates/Trusts: $29,900

**Exemption Phase-Out:**
Exemption reduced by 25% of AMTI exceeding:
- Single/HOH: $609,350
- MFJ: $1,218,700
- MFS: $609,350

**Complete Phase-Out at:**
- Single/HOH: $952,150
- MFJ: $1,751,900
- MFS: $875,950

**Step 6: Calculate Tentative Minimum Tax**

**AMT Tax Rates:**
- 26% on first $220,700 of AMT income ($110,350 MFS)
- 28% on AMT income above that amount

**Capital Gains Treatment:**
- Long-term capital gains taxed at same preferential rates
- 0%, 15%, or 20% rates apply
- 25% rate for unrecaptured Section 1250
- 28% rate for collectibles

**Step 7: Compare to Regular Tax**
AMT = Greater of:
- Tentative Minimum Tax, or
- Regular Tax
Minus Regular Tax (if TMT is greater)

If TMT ≤ Regular Tax, no AMT is owed.

#### 1.9.3 AMT Credit (Form 8801)

**Purpose:**
The AMT credit allows recovery of AMT paid due to timing differences in future years when regular tax exceeds TMT.

**Deferral vs. Exclusion Items:**

**Deferral Items (Generate Credit):**
- Depreciation timing differences
- Incentive Stock Option exercise
- Installment sale deferral
- Long-term contracts

**Exclusion Items (No Credit):**
- Standard deduction
- State and local taxes
- Personal exemptions
- Miscellaneous itemized deductions
- Private activity bond interest

**Credit Calculation:**
1. Calculate AMT that would have been owed using only exclusion items
2. Subtract from actual AMT paid
3. Difference is credit carryforward
4. Usable when regular tax exceeds TMT

**Carryforward:**
- Indefinite carryforward
- No expiration
- Used when regular tax exceeds TMT

## SECTION 2: BUSINESS TAX RETURNS - DETAILED GUIDANCE

### 2.1 PARTNERSHIP TAXATION (FORM 1065) - COMPREHENSIVE

#### 2.1.1 Partnership Formation Tax Issues

**Section 721 - Nonrecognition on Contribution:**
The general rule is that no gain or loss is recognized when property is contributed to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest.

**Requirements for Nonrecognition:**
1. Transfer of property
2. To a partnership
3. In exchange for an interest in the partnership

**What Constitutes "Property":**
- Cash
- Tangible property
- Intangible property
- Accounts receivable
- Inventory
- Unrealized receivables
- Goodwill

**What is NOT "Property" for Section 721:**
- Services (compensation triggers recognition)
- Future services promised
- Use of property without transfer

**Exceptions to Nonrecognition:**

**Investment Company Exception (IRC §721(b)):**
Gain recognized if transfer results in diversification of transferor's interests.
- Applies when 80%+ of partnership assets are stock, securities, etc.
- Contribution of appreciated stock to investment partnership triggers gain

**Disguised Sale Exception (IRC §707(a)(2)(B)):**
Contributions followed by distributions may be treated as sales.
- Two-year presumption period
- Facts and circumstances test
- Debt relief may constitute sale proceeds

**Section 724 - Character of Gain/Loss:**
Character rules for subsequent sale of contributed property:
- Unrealized receivables: Ordinary income
- Inventory items: Ordinary income (5-year rule)
- Capital loss property: Capital loss

#### 2.1.2 Partnership Basis Rules - Outside and Inside

**Outside Basis (Partner's Basis in Partnership Interest):**

**Initial Basis Equals:**
- Cash contributed
- Adjusted basis of property contributed
- Plus: Partner's share of partnership liabilities
- Minus: Any liabilities assumed by partnership on contributed property

**Basis Increases:**
- Partner's share of income items (ordinary and separately stated)
- Partner's share of tax-exempt income
- Increase in partner's share of liabilities
- Additional contributions

**Basis Decreases (in order):**
1. Distributions of money (including marketable securities)
2. Partner's share of losses and deductions
3. Partner's share of nondeductible, noncapitalizable expenses
4. Decrease in partner's share of liabilities

**Ordering Rules for Decreases:**
- Basis cannot go below zero
- Losses limited to basis
- Distributions reduce basis before loss items

**Inside Basis (Partnership's Basis in Assets):**

**Initial Basis of Contributed Property:**
- Carryover basis from contributing partner
- Adjusted for any gain recognized

**Holding Period:**
- Tacks onto contributing partner's holding period
- Exception: Ordinary income property starts new holding period

**Section 704(c) Implications:**
Built-in gain or loss at contribution must be allocated to contributing partner.
Methods:
- Traditional method
- Traditional with curative allocations
- Remedial method

#### 2.1.3 Partnership Allocations and Substantial Economic Effect

**General Rule:**
Partner's distributive share determined by partnership agreement if it has "substantial economic effect."

**Economic Effect Requirements (Reg. §1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)):**
1. Capital accounts maintained in accordance with regulations
2. Liquidating distributions based on positive capital accounts
3. Deficit restoration obligation OR qualified income offset

**Safe Harbor for Economic Effect:**
- Proper capital account maintenance
- Liquidating distribution requirement
- Either:
  - Unlimited deficit restoration obligation, OR
  - Qualified income offset provision

**Substantiality Requirement:**
Allocation must have reasonable possibility of affecting dollar amounts received by partners independent of tax consequences.

**Allocations Lacking Substantiality:**
- Shifting allocations (current year)
- Transitory allocations (different years)
- Overall tax effect test

**Special Allocations:**
Partnership agreement can allocate specific items differently from general profit/loss allocation if meets substantial economic effect rules.

**Examples of Valid Special Allocations:**
- Depreciation to partner contributing property
- Tax credits to partner who can utilize
- Capital gains to specific partners

**Partner's Interest in the Partnership (PIP):**
Default allocation method when allocation lacks substantial economic effect.
Factors considered:
- Partners' relative contributions
- Interest in economic profits and losses
- Interest in cash flow and other nonliquidating distributions
- Rights to distributions on liquidation

#### 2.1.4 Partnership Liabilities and Basis

**Importance of Liability Allocation:**
Partner's basis includes share of partnership liabilities, which affects:
- Ability to deduct losses
- Recognition of gain on distributions
- At-risk amounts

**Recourse Liabilities:**
Liabilities for which a partner (or related person) bears economic risk of loss.

**Economic Risk of Loss (EROL):**
Partner has EROL to extent partner would be obligated to make payment to creditor (or contribution to partnership) if partnership had no assets and all liabilities became due.

**Factors Creating EROL:**
- General partner status
- Personal guarantees
- Indemnification agreements
- Obligation to contribute capital
- Pledged property

**Allocation of Recourse Liabilities:**
- Allocated to partner(s) bearing EROL
- Multiple partners: Allocated in ratio of EROL
- May change if facts change

**Nonrecourse Liabilities:**
Liabilities for which no partner bears economic risk of loss (secured only by partnership property).

**Three-Tier Allocation (Reg. §1.752-3):**

**Tier 1: Section 704(c) Minimum Gain**
Allocate to partner with built-in gain in property securing debt.
Amount: Excess of nonrecourse debt over partner's share of basis in securing property.

**Tier 2: Partnership Minimum Gain**
Allocate based on each partner's share of partnership minimum gain.
- Partnership minimum gain = Excess of nonrecourse debt over property's adjusted basis
- Allocated based on prior chargeback allocations

**Tier 3: Remaining Nonrecourse Liabilities**
Allocate based on profit-sharing ratios.
Alternatives available:
- Reasonably consistent with allocations having substantial economic effect
- Manner reasonably expected to be significant contributors to partnership income

**Qualified Nonrecourse Financing:**
Special rule for real estate allows nonrecourse debt to count for at-risk purposes if:
- Debt secured by real property used in activity
- Lender is bank, government, or unrelated person engaged in lending
- No convertible debt
- Not from seller or promoter

**Partnership Liability Changes:**
- Increase in partner's share: Treated as contribution (basis increase)
- Decrease in partner's share: Treated as distribution (may trigger gain)

#### 2.1.5 Partnership Distributions

**Current Distributions:**

**General Rule (IRC §731):**
No gain or loss recognized on current distributions except:
- Money exceeds basis (gain recognized)
- Marketable securities exceeds basis (gain recognized)

**Basis Effects:**
- Partner's basis reduced by money received
- Partner's basis reduced by partnership's basis in distributed property
- If property basis would reduce partner's basis below zero, property takes basis equal to remaining partner's basis

**Distributed Property Basis (IRC §732):**
- Generally equals partnership's basis
- Limited to partner's basis in partnership (less money received)
- Allocation rules apply if multiple properties distributed

**Holding Period:**
- Includes partnership's holding period
- Exception: Unrealized receivables and inventory

**Character of Distributed Property:**
- Section 735 rules apply
- Unrealized receivables remain ordinary income property (no time limit)
- Inventory remains ordinary income property (5 years)
- Capital loss property remains capital (5 years)

**Liquidating Distributions:**

**Complete Liquidation of Partner's Interest:**

**Gain Recognition:**
Only when money (and marketable securities) exceeds basis.

**Loss Recognition:**
Only when:
- Only money, unrealized receivables, and inventory received
- Amount received is less than basis

**Basis of Distributed Property:**
- Equals remaining basis in partnership interest
- Allocated among properties received
- Allocation rules prioritize unrealized receivables and inventory

**Basis Allocation for Liquidating Distributions:**

**Step 1:** Assign bases to unrealized receivables and inventory (inside basis or FMV if less)

**Step 2:** Allocate remaining basis to other properties:
- First, to extent of inside basis
- Then, decrease based on relative FMV if total inside basis exceeds available basis
- Or increase based on relative FMV if available basis exceeds inside basis

**Disproportionate Distributions (IRC §751):**

**Hot Assets:**
- Unrealized receivables (including Section 1245/1250 recapture)
- Inventory items (substantially appreciated inventory)

**Substantially Appreciated Inventory:**
FMV exceeds 120% of adjusted basis
All inventory items considered together

**Effect of Section 751:**
Disproportionate distribution treated as:
- Taxable exchange of hot assets for other property
- Ordinary income/loss recognized on hot asset portion

#### 2.1.6 Sale of Partnership Interest

**General Rule (IRC §741):**
Gain or loss from sale of partnership interest is capital gain or loss.

**Amount of Gain/Loss:**
Amount realized - Adjusted basis = Gain/Loss

**Amount Realized Includes:**
- Cash received
- FMV of property received
- Relief from share of partnership liabilities

**Adjusted Basis:**
Partner's outside basis at time of sale (including share of liabilities).

**Section 751 Ordinary Income:**
Portion of gain attributable to hot assets is ordinary income.
- Unrealized receivables
- Inventory items (substantially appreciated)

**Calculation:**
1. Determine total gain/loss
2. Determine gain attributable to Section 751 assets (FMV - partner's share of basis)
3. Section 751 gain is ordinary
4. Remainder is capital

**Section 743(b) Adjustment (Optional):**

**Section 754 Election:**
Partnership may elect to adjust inside basis of assets when:
- Partnership interest transferred (Section 743(b))
- Partnership property distributed (Section 734(b))

**Section 743(b) Adjustment:**
Difference between:
- Transferee's outside basis (purchase price plus share of liabilities)
- Transferee's share of partnership's inside basis

**Effect:**
- Special basis adjustment belongs only to transferee
- Affects depreciation, gain/loss on sale
- Reduces or eliminates differences between inside and outside basis

**Mandatory Basis Adjustment:**
Required (regardless of Section 754 election) if:
- Substantial built-in loss exists
- Built-in loss exceeds $250,000

#### 2.2.5 Built-In Gains Tax

**Background:**
Tax imposed on C to S conversions to prevent avoidance of corporate-level tax on appreciated assets.

**When Tax Applies:**
- C corporation converted to S corporation
- S corporation acquired C corporation assets in tax-free reorganization
- Asset had built-in gain at conversion date
- Asset sold within recognition period

**Recognition Period:**
- 5-year period beginning on first day as S corporation
- Historically 10 years, reduced multiple times

**Built-In Gain Calculation:**

**Step 1 - Identify Built-In Gain Assets:**
Assets with FMV > Adjusted Basis at conversion date.

**Step 2 - Calculate Net Recognized Built-In Gain (NRBIG):**
Lesser of:
- Recognized built-in gain (gain on sale limited to built-in gain)
- Taxable income (using C corporation rules)
- Net unrealized built-in gain (NUBIG) less NRBIG from prior years

**Step 3 - Calculate Tax:**
NRBIG × 21% (corporate rate)

**Net Unrealized Built-In Gain (NUBIG):**
Total of all built-in gains less built-in losses at conversion date.
- Maximum cumulative tax base
- Tracks over recognition period

**Reductions to NUBIG:**
- Built-in losses recognized
- Built-in deductions (depreciation scheduled at conversion)
- Carryforwards from C years used

**Tax Impact:**
- Tax paid at corporate level
- Shareholders get basis adjustment for tax paid
- Reduces pass-through income

#### 2.2.6 Passive Investment Income Tax and Termination Risk

- Annuities
- Sales of stock or securities (gain only)

**Exceptions:**
- Rents derived in active trade or business
- Rents from real property (with significant services)
- Interest on notes from sale of inventory
- Interest from lending business

**Tax Calculation:**
Tax = Excess Net Passive Income × Highest Corporate Rate (21%)

**Excess Net Passive Income:**
NPI × (PII - 25% × GR) / PII

Where:
- NPI = Net Passive Income
- PII = Passive Investment Income
- GR = Gross Receipts

**S Election Termination Risk:**
If corporation has:
- Accumulated E&P, AND
- Passive investment income > 25% of gross receipts
- For THREE consecutive years

Then S election automatically terminates.

**Planning:**
- Distribute or eliminate accumulated E&P
- Increase active business income

**Purpose:**
Prevents use of corporations to shelter passive investment income.

**Tax Rate:**
20% on undistributed personal holding company income

**Definition of PHC:**
Corporation meeting BOTH:
1. Stock ownership test: More than 50% owned (directly or constructively) by 5 or fewer individuals during last half of tax year

States automatically adopt IRC changes as enacted.
- Most current federal law
- Less legislative action needed
- Examples: Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Montana, New Mexico

**Static/Fixed-Date Conformity:**
States conform to IRC as of specific date.
- Must update legislation for new federal provisions
- May lag behind federal law
- Examples: Arizona (12/31/2022), North Carolina (4/1/2023)

**Selective Conformity:**
States adopt specific IRC provisions.
- Cherry-pick federal provisions
- May have unique calculations
- Examples: Arkansas, Mississippi

- Bonus depreciation percentages
- Section 179 limits
- QBI deduction (Section 199A)
- NOL rules
- Interest expense limitations (Section 163(j))

- Apportioned based on business activity
- Factors: Sales, payroll, property

**Rental Income:**
- Sourced to property location
- Deductions follow income

**Capital Gains:**
- Tangible personal property: Where property located
- Intangible property: Usually resident state
- Real property: Where located

**Retirement Income:**
- Federal law protects from source-state taxation
- Taxed by resident state only

**Credit for Taxes Paid:**

**Purpose:**
Prevent double taxation of same income.

**Calculation:**
Lesser of:

- Three traditional factors: Sales, payroll, property

**Apportionment Formulas:**

**Traditional Three-Factor:**
(Sales Factor + Payroll Factor + Property Factor) / 3

**Double-Weighted Sales:**
(2 × Sales Factor + Payroll Factor + Property Factor) / 4

**Single Sales Factor:**
Sales Factor only (increasingly common)

**Sales Factor Calculation:**
Sales in State / Total Sales Everywhere

**Sourcing Methods:**
- Cost of performance (traditional)
- Market-based sourcing (modern trend)

**Payroll Factor:**
Compensation Paid in State / Total Compensation

**Sourcing:**
